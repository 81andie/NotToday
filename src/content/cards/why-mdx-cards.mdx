<Card>
  # {frontmatter.art}

  tldr; To use `markdown` *dummy!*

  A tip card can do a lot, like help you understand the point of using MDX for these cards.

  The MDX to this card is relatively simple compared to product cards. I can use it to record
  short tips, and it will get its own page, but also can be displayed as a card on some other page.

  And since this is MDX I can do stuff like code snippets.

  ```markdown
  # And maybe the card will end with an enticing headline!
  ```
